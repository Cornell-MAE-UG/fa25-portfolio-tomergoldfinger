  <h1>Ethical Analysis of the Boeing 737 MAX Crashes</h1>

  <p>
    The Boeing 737 MAX crashes represent a useful ethical analysis for students. The case illustrates how technical design decisions, organizational behavior, and regulatory structures interact in engineering systems with direct consequences for human safety. By applying the ASME Code of Ethics and examining facts, constraints, and  decision, the analysis demonstrates that ethical responsibility in engineering extends beyond technical compliance and requires sustained attention to complex social interactions with competing stakeholder interests.
  </p>

  <p>
    As established in the Week 6 ethical issue analysis, one of the central technical concerns in the 737 MAX case was the design and certification of the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS. MCAS was introduced to counteract aerodynamic changes resulting from the repositioning of larger engines on the aircraft. However, the system relied on data from a single angle of attack sensor and could repeatedly command nose down trim without explicit pilot awareness. This design choice created a single point of failure in a safety critical system. Under Canon 1 of the ASME Code of Ethics, engineers are required to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public. Certifying a control system with limited redundancy and known failure modes conflicted directly with this obligation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Week 6 also identified the ethical issue of whether engineers should escalate concerns beyond the normal chain of command. Internal reports and simulator data indicated abnormal MCAS behavior, yet these concerns were not effectively acted upon. Engineers faced professional pressure, fear of retaliation, and reliance on management judgment. When internal escalation fails, the ethical duty to protect the public requires engineers to seek alternative reporting channels. This conclusion follows directly from the hierarchy of canons discussed in Week 6, where public safety takes precedence over loyalty to an employer.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Week 7 definitional clarification further revealed how differing interpretations of key terms shaped ethical judgment in the 737 MAX program. Boeing, the FAA, and the victims’ families defined concepts such as safety, oversight, simplicity, and success in fundamentally different ways. Boeing often framed safety as regulatory compliance and system performance under expected conditions, while the families of victims defined safety in terms of redundancy and zero tolerance for catastrophic failure. These conflicting definitions allowed serious risks to be minimized when viewed through a narrow regulatory lens. Week 7 demonstrates that ethical failure can occur even when formal rules are followed if critical terms are defined in ways that obscure human consequences.
  </p>

  <p>
    The analysis of relevant facts and reasonable assumptions developed later in Week 7 showed that organizational incentives played a major role in shaping decision making. Boeing management faced competitive pressure from Airbus and strong financial incentives to minimize pilot training and manual changes. These pressures help explain why MCAS was excluded from pilot documentation and why proposed safety improvements were rejected. While not all motivations were explicitly documented, the assumptions made in Week 7 are consistent with known patterns of behavior and provide reasonable explanations for why safety concerns were downplayed.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Week 8, the ethical issues were refined and resolved through a structured application of the ASME Code of Ethics. The analysis concluded that engineers should not have certified MCAS in its original form, that pilots should have been fully informed through manuals and training, and that the FAA should have grounded the aircraft earlier. Each resolution was justified by placing Canon 1 above competing obligations such as loyalty, economic impact, or institutional reputation. Week 8 also emphasized that FAA delegation of oversight to Boeing through the Organization Designation Authorization program created conflicts of interest that undermined independent safety review.
  </p>

  <p>
    The delayed grounding of the 737 MAX after the first crash further illustrates the ethical reasoning presented in Week 8. Despite evidence of systemic failure and international concern, grounding was postponed due to reputational and economic considerations. From an ethical standpoint, precautionary action should occur as soon as credible safety risks emerge. The FAA’s hesitation conflicted with its primary obligation to protect the public and demonstrated how institutional incentives can interfere with ethical decision making.
  </p>

  <p>
    Week 9 addressed the practical constraints that prevented ideal ethical action throughout the case. Engineers trusted regulatory approval, feared professional consequences, and often lacked full system level visibility. Organizational culture rewarded speed and cost reduction, while systemic factors encouraged self regulation and regulatory capture. These constraints do not excuse the outcomes, but they help explain how ethical lapses can persist even when individuals believe they are acting reasonably within their roles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Week 9 also proposed prevention strategies at the individual, organizational, and systemic levels. Individually, engineers must be trained to recognize ethical warning signs and encouraged to report concerns early. Organizationally, companies must establish protected whistleblower channels and remove incentives that discourage transparency. At the systemic level, regulators must maintain independence and sufficient technical expertise to perform thorough oversight. These strategies directly respond to the constraints identified earlier and aim to prevent similar failures in future engineering projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    In conclusion, the Boeing 737 MAX crashes demonstrate that ethical failure in engineering is rarely the result of a single mistake. Instead, it emerges from the interaction of technical design choices, organizational priorities, regulatory structures, and human decision making over time. Drawing on the analyses completed in Weeks 6 through 9, this case shows that ethical engineering practice requires clear definitions, transparent communication, independent oversight, and a consistent commitment to public safety. When these elements are weakened, even highly advanced engineering systems can produce devastating outcomes.
