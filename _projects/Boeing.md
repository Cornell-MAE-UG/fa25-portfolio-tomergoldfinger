## Introduction

The goal of this project is to engage in an ethical analysis of the crashes of the Boeing 737 Max airplanes.
In particular, this study will look at the facts, stakeholders, relevant ethical principles, scenarios,
questions, and solutions as it relates to the crashes. In doing so, it will allow me to practice ethical
decision making and dissect where responsibilities and solutions lie in ethical dilemmas.

  <summary><h2>Week 7: Definitional Clarification</h2></summary>

  <p>
    Ethical analysis often depends on how key terms are defined by different stakeholders.
    In this section, several important terms related to the Boeing 737 MAX case are examined
    through the perspectives of Boeing, the FAA, and the victims’ families.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Term 1: Oversight</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Boeing:</strong> Oversight means obtaining the required legal approvals and certifications where necessary.</li>
    <li><strong>FAA:</strong> Oversight involves reviewing all aspects of aircraft systems to ensure regulatory compliance and safety.</li>
    <li><strong>Victims’ Families:</strong> Oversight requires independent analysis and evaluation of all potential safety risks.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Different definitions of oversight significantly affect ethical judgment. If oversight is
    viewed as a procedural requirement, failures may seem acceptable. If defined as active,
    independent safety verification, ethical responsibility becomes much greater.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Term 2: Success</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Boeing:</strong> Success is defined as increasing profit and maintaining market competitiveness.</li>
    <li><strong>FAA:</strong> Success means adherence to aviation regulations and certification standards.</li>
    <li><strong>Victims’ Families:</strong> Success is defined as ensuring safe flights and preventing loss of life.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Ethical conclusions differ based on which definition of success is used. Financial or
    regulatory success may mask serious ethical failures if safety outcomes are ignored.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Term 3: Safety</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Boeing:</strong> Safety means that engineering systems operate as designed under expected conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>FAA:</strong> Safety is defined as legal adherence to established safety regulations.</li>
    <li><strong>Victims’ Families:</strong> Safety requires multiple redundancies, diligence, and zero tolerance for catastrophic failure.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When safety is narrowly defined as regulatory or technical compliance, ethical responsibility
    is minimized. Broader definitions emphasize moral obligations to prevent harm at all costs.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Term 4: Simplicity</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Boeing:</strong> Simplicity involves minimizing changes to flight manuals and pilot training.</li>
    <li><strong>FAA:</strong> Simplicity refers to minimizing engineering changes while maintaining compliance.</li>
    <li><strong>Victims’ Families:</strong> Simplicity requires full disclosure of all aircraft features necessary for safe flight.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If simplicity prioritizes convenience over understanding, ethical risk increases.
    Transparent communication may complicate systems but improves safety.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Term 5: Failure</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Boeing:</strong> Failure is associated with financial loss and reputational damage.</li>
    <li><strong>FAA:</strong> Failure occurs when regulations are not properly applied or enforced.</li>
    <li><strong>Victims’ Families:</strong> Failure is defined by aircraft crashes and loss of human life.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Ethical judgment shifts drastically depending on whether failure is viewed as an economic,
    procedural, or human outcome. Centering human consequences highlights the severity of ethical failures.

  <h2>Determining Relevant Facts</h2>

  <!-- Material Facts -->
  <section class="material-facts">
    <h3>Material Facts (Technical / System-Level)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Boeing 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in 2019 following two fatal crashes.
        This grounding disrupted airline schedules globally and resulted in significant
        financial losses for airlines, customers, and Boeing.
      </li>
      <li>
        The United States was one of the last countries to ground the 737 MAX, despite
        mounting international concern. This delay increased passenger exposure to risk
        due to flaws in the regulatory oversight process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Design changes to the 737 MAX, including larger engines mounted further forward
        and higher on the wing, altered the aircraft’s aerodynamics and increased the
        likelihood of a nose-up pitching moment.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) was introduced to
        counteract this nose-up tendency by automatically commanding nose-down trim
        under certain conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        MCAS relied on a single angle-of-attack (AoA) sensor input. A miscalibrated or
        faulty AoA sensor could trigger repeated nose-down commands, contributing
        directly to loss of control in both fatal crashes.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Individual Facts -->
  <section class="individual-facts">
    <h3>Individual Facts (Personal Decisions / Actions)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        FAA engineers identified a lack of redundancy in the MCAS design but did not
        require Boeing to implement additional safeguards, partially due to cost and
        schedule pressures.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boeing engineers minimized or ignored early simulator test failures related to
        MCAS behavior rather than fully investigating and correcting the root causes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Key Boeing personnel withheld detailed information about MCAS from pilots by
        excluding it from flight manuals and training materials, leaving pilots
        unprepared to respond during emergencies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boeing engineers proposed additional safety features that could have mitigated
        MCAS risks, but these proposals were rejected by management due to cost and
        certification concerns.
      </li>
      <li>
        Factory workers failed to properly install a critical bolt on at least one
        aircraft, contributing to downstream safety risks. This failure was influenced
        by production pressure and an environment that prioritized speed over quality.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Organizational Facts -->
  <section class="organizational-facts">
    <h3>Organizational Facts (Institutional / Corporate)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Boeing’s corporate culture emphasized cost reduction, rapid production, and
        competition with Airbus, often at the expense of engineering safety margins.
      </li>
      <li>
        The FAA’s Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) program delegated large
        portions of aircraft certification to Boeing itself, weakening independent
        regulatory oversight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boeing intentionally limited pilot training requirements for the 737 MAX to
        preserve its marketing promise of “no simulator training required,” increasing
        reliance on automation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Internal communication breakdowns between Boeing management, engineers, and
        regulators prevented critical safety concerns from being addressed in a timely
        manner.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the crashes, Boeing’s public relations strategy focused on deflecting
        blame and minimizing responsibility rather than immediately prioritizing
        transparency and accountability.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</section>
<section id="reasonable-assumptions">
  <h2>Making Reasonable Assumptions</h2>

  <p>
    In complex engineering failures such as the Boeing 737 MAX case, not all relevant
    facts are publicly known. However, reasonable assumptions can be made based on
    available evidence, documented patterns of behavior, and typical organizational
    practices.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Missing Fact:</strong>
      The precise reasons why the FAA took longer than other international regulators
      to ground the 737 MAX are not fully documented.
      <br>
      <strong>Reasonable Assumption:</strong>
      It is reasonable to assume that the FAA was incentivized to delay grounding due
      to Boeing’s reputation as a major American aerospace manufacturer and the economic
      and political pressure to avoid grounding a U.S.-produced aircraft.
      <br>
      <strong>Supporting Evidence:</strong>
      Boeing employees were embedded within the FAA certification process, and the FAA
      relied heavily on Boeing-provided data under the Organization Designation
      Authorization (ODA) system.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Missing Fact:</strong>
      The exact motivations behind Boeing management’s decision to downplay or overlook
      simulator failures related to MCAS are not fully known.
      <br>
      <strong>Reasonable Assumption:</strong>
      It is reasonable to assume that Boeing management was under pressure to certify
      and release the 737 MAX as quickly as possible in order to compete with Airbus and
      protect market share.
      <br>
      <strong>Supporting Evidence:</strong>
      Boeing prioritized maintaining a common type rating with earlier 737 models and
      marketed the aircraft as requiring minimal pilot retraining.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Missing Fact:</strong>
      The specific reasons why documentation for a missing or improperly installed bolt
      on at least one aircraft was incomplete are not fully known.
      <br>
      <strong>Reasonable Assumption:</strong>
      It is reasonable to assume that this documentation failure was part of broader
      cost-cutting and oversight-reduction measures implemented throughout Boeing’s
      manufacturing process.
      <br>
      <strong>Supporting Evidence:</strong>
      Boeing attempted to reduce internal and external oversight across multiple stages
      of design, manufacturing, and certification in order to streamline production.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Missing Fact:</strong>
      The full reasoning behind Boeing’s decision to conceal or minimize MCAS design
      changes from pilots and flight manuals is not completely known.
      <br>
      <strong>Reasonable Assumption:</strong>
      It is reasonable to assume that Boeing sought to reduce the number of required
      changes to flight manuals in order to preserve the aircraft’s marketability and
      uphold its promise of minimal pilot retraining.
      <br>
      <strong>Supporting Evidence:</strong>
      Boeing had pledged to cover airline costs if extensive changes to flight manuals
      or training requirements were introduced, creating a financial incentive to limit
      disclosed system changes.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Missing Fact:</strong>
      The precise rationale for Boeing’s resistance to implementing additional safety
      features on the 737 MAX is not fully documented.
      <br>
      <strong>Reasonable Assumption:</strong>
      It is reasonable to assume that Boeing avoided adding further safety features in
      order to cut costs and accelerate production and certification timelines.
      <br>
      <strong>Supporting Evidence:</strong>
      Boeing faced intense financial and competitive pressure from Airbus, particularly
      following the success of the A320neo, incentivizing rapid market entry and cost
      minimization.

## conclusion
In conclusion, the ethical analysis of the Boeing 737 MAX crashes demonstrates how technical design decisions, individual actions, and organizational pressures can combine to produce catastrophic outcomes when ethical responsibilities are not upheld. By examining the relevant facts, identifying key stakeholders, and applying ethical principles, this project highlights the importance of transparency, accountability, and prioritizing public safety in engineering practice. The analysis underscores that ethical decision-making is not confined to a single individual or moment, but rather distributed across systems, organizations, and regulatory bodies.
