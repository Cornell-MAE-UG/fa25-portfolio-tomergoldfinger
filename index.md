## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Profile_Picture.jpeg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Tomer Goldfinger, and I am a senior at Cornell University, studying mechanical engineering. Mainly, I focus on studying the design and development of renewable energy systems in my academic and extracurricular pursuits.

MAE 4272 was a perfect opportunity to gain hands on experience in learning about this. In this course, Fluids and Heat Transfer Laboratory, we engaged in project and lab based analysis of harvesting energy through wind turbine blades, as well as studying the thermodynamics and mechanics of a forklift engine. 

I am also very curious about the way which engineering systems interact with the surrounding world. To supplement this interest, I took the course MAE 4300: Engineers and Society, where I engaged in an interesting ethical analysis of Boeing's responsibility in the 737 Max plane crashes.
